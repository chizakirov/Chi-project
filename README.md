    1. built functionalities including search a stock by its ticker symbol, trade execution based on a real-time price, news and research related to any publicly tradedcompanies
    2. integrated data from 2 stock market APIs and created a chart using Plotly.js library based on real-time data
    3. added styling for the rest of the website

    1. researched integration between Angular and D3 for the chart
    2. added styling for the tables, background images, and fonts
